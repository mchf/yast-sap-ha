<h3>HANA System Replication Azure</h3>
<p>Before proceeding with the installation, please make sure of the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        There are two machines with SAP HANA installed.
        <br> Note that the machine you run the wizard on becomes the primary node in the cluster.
    </li>
    <li>
        There is a firewall configured using the SAP HANA Firewall module in Administrator Settings, and <code>HANA_HIGH_AVAILABILITY</code> and <code>HANA_SYSTEM_REPLICATION</code> services are enabled on <i>all</i> relevant network interfaces.
    </li>
    <li>
        You have created one of the following:
        <ul type="square">
            <li>
                A key in the HANA Secure User Store (using the <code>hdbuserstore</code> utility) on the primary HANA node.
                <br/> If you are configuring a multi-tenant HANA installation (default for HANA versions 2.0 SPS01 and above), please make sure that the secure store key is properly configured for connecting to the <code>SystemDB</code>, i.e., specify port <code>3&lt;SID&gt;13</code> in the environment settings and <code>SystemDB</code> as the target database.
            </li>
            <li>
                An initial HANA backup (of the <code>SystemDB</code> and all tenant databases, in an MDC setup) on the primary HANA node. <br/>
                Please note that if you prefer to perform backup manually on HANA 2.0, you should also make sure that the SSFS keys are the same on both HANA nodes.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>For SUSE Linux Enterprise Server version 15 and later:</i> please ensure that during the HA setup procedure the TCP port <code>8080</code> is open on the secondary node. After the HA setup is complete, please enable the <code>cluster</code> service in <code>firewalld</code> on both nodes.
    </li>
