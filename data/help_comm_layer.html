<h2>Cluster Communication Layer</h2>
This step tunes the cluster's communication layer.
<br><br>
<b>Transport mode</b> defines the transport mode of the corosync messaging layer. Unicast (default) is preferred in most of the configurations.
<br><br>
<b>Number of rings</b>. This parameter allows you to set more than one communication rings for redundancy. It is highly recommended to have at least 2 rings. For more information, refer to the SUSE High Availability Guide, section 3.5.2 <a href="https://www.suse.com/documentation/sle_ha/book_sleha/data/sec_ha_installation_setup_manual.html#sec_ha_installation_setup_channels">"Defining the Communication Channels"</a>.
<br><br>
For every ring a binding address and a port should be specified. If you use Multicast transport mode, one multicast address has to be provided per each ring.
<br><br>
<b>Cluster name</b> is the internal name of the cluster.
<br><br>
<b>Expected votes</b> is the parameter defining the quorum of the cluster.
