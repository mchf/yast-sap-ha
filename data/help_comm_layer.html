    <h2>Cluster Communication Layer</h2>
    <p>This step tunes the cluster's communication layer.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Transport mode</b> defines the transport mode of the corosync messaging layer.
        Unicast (default) is preferred in most of the configurations.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Number of rings</b>. This parameter allows you to set more than one communication rings
        for redundancy. It is highly recommended to have at least 2 rings. For more information,
        refer to the SUSE High Availability Guide, section 3.5.2 <a href="https://www.suse.com/documentation/sle_ha/book_sleha/data/sec_ha_installation_setup_manual.html#sec_ha_installation_setup_channels">
        "Defining the Communication Channels"</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        For every ring a binding address and a port should be specified.
        If you use Multicast transport mode, one multicast address has to be 
        provided per each ring.
    </p>
    <p><b>Cluster name</b> is the internal name of the cluster.</p>
    <p><b>Expected votes</b> is the parameter defining the quorum of the cluster.</p>
