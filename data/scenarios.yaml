        <h3>HANA System Replication Scale Up: Multi-tier</h3>
        <p>Before proceeding with the installation, please make sure of the following:<p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                You have two machines within the same L2 network segment with SAP HANA installed 
                using the "SAP Product Installer".<br>
                Note that the machine you run the wizard on becomes the primary node in the cluster.
            </li>
            <li>
                You have a remote HANA machine in another data center, which have to be registered manually.
            </li>
            <li>
                The second node has to have a secondary, non-production HANA instance installed.
            </li>
            <li>
                You have configured the firewall (using the SAP HANA Firewall module in the 
                Administrator Settings), enabling the <code>HANA_HIGH_AVAILABILITY</code> and

                When the Wizard is finished configuring the two-node cluster, make sure to register
                the third node for system replication like so:<br>
                    <code>hdbnsutil -sr_register --remoteHost=$(secondary_host_name)
