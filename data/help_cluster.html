    <h2>Cluster</h2>
    <p>This step tunes the cluster's communication layer.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Transport mode</b> defines the transport mode of the corosync messaging layer.
        Unicast (default) is preferred in most of the configurations.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Number of rings</b>. This parameter allows you to set more than one communication rings
        for redundancy. It is highly recommended to have at least 2 rings. For more information,
        refer to the SUSE High Availability Guide, section 3.5.2 <a href="https://www.suse.com/documentation/sle_ha/book_sleha/data/sec_ha_installation_setup_manual.html#sec_ha_installation_setup_channels">
        "Defining the Communication Channels"</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        For every ring a binding address and a port should be specified.
        If you use Multicast transport mode, one multicast address has to be 
        provided per each ring.
    </p>
    <p><b>Cluster name</b> is the internal name of the cluster.</p>
    <p><b>Expected votes</b> is the parameter defining the quorum of the cluster.</p>

    <p>This dialog allows you to control the number of nodes in the cluster and their respective IP addresses.<br/>
    Please make sure that the provided IP addresses correspond to the network addresses of the rings.</p>
    
    <p><i>Note:</i> the number of nodes for HANA scale-up clusters is fixed and cannot be changed.</p>

    <p><b>Enable Corosync Secure Authentication</b>:
    require the HMAC/SHA1 authentication for cluster messages authentication.
    This option reduces total throughput of the cluster messaging level and consumes extra CPU cycles for encryption.
    </p>

    <p><b>Enable csync2</b>: enable the <code>csync2</code> service that synchronizes cluster-related configuration files between nodes.</p>

    <h3>On passwordless SSH</h3>
    <p>When the "Next" button is clicked, the Wizard will check if it can connect to the remote node(s) via SSH protocol without a password.
    If it fails to do so, it will require the root password for the remote node, connect to it and propagate its own SSH keys (both private and public) to the slave node(s).</p>
